# JARVIS Offline Assistant (Python Project)

This is my Python project where I made a offline assistant which responds to text commands and gives voice output using pyttsx3. It is not like highly advanced AI assistant but it can do some common tasks and helped me understand how automation works in python. It works offline so no API or internet is required except when google or youtube is opened. I made this project mainly for Vidyarthi submission and also to improve my python programming understanding.

## Features

The assistant can do things like telling the time and date, searching on google or youtube, writing and reading notes, managing a small todo list, opening notepad or calculator and telling a random programming joke just for fun. It also stores history of commands and speaks output which makes it feel more interactive.

## Requirements

It only needs Python (I used Python 3.12) and one library which is pyttsx3 for the voice output. It works offline completely and does not require any online services.

To install the required library use the command:

pip install pyttsx3

## How to Run

To run the project, open the terminal in the folder where jarvis.py is saved and then type:

python jarvis.py

After that the assistant will start and talk. Make sure the speaker volume is on.

## Example Commands

Some example commands you can type are:

time  
date  
google python tutorial  
youtube music  
note  
read notes  
todo  
opennotepad  
joke  
exit

These commands make the assistant perform the related action.

## Files in the Project

The project mainly contains jarvis.py which has the full python code, README.md which is this file, and statement.md/report which explains why the project was made and what is the idea behind it.

## Learning Outcome

From making this project I learned how to use file handling, modules, functions, loops and how to connect different python features together to make one useful script. I also learned basic text to speech and troubleshooting errors specially with libraries.

## Future Improvements

In future I want to add voice input (speech recognition) and maybe a GUI using Tkinter. Also features like alarm, reminders and more natural conversation mode can be added.
